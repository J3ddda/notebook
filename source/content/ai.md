i bet AI will develop emotions by learning.

how do we know whats true? we can feel it in the body.
the body is in a position of truth at all times.
we can measure this somehow.

[[emotions]][[ascension]][[IRL cultural experiment]][[time]][[the keys]][[Phone nervous system]][[past lives]][[double or triple numbers (angel numbers)]]

Give ai a body and itll learn the impulses.
im not afraid of ai, im afraid of what will happen if we dont keep testing/learning our own bodies wisdom and fall asleep on the ways our lives will be influenced by this.
