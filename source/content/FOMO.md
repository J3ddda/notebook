interesting that this sentence has made it so far along the "used many times" meta path thats its ended up with its own acronym (Like wtf, gtfo, NATO, UN, wdym, lmao, lol etc).
This also leads into "people being attacked by information - how misinformation might spread" territory.
Here is a fun mental game to help you get to know why i think its important. (it helps put this idea into different perspectives and bridge the two concepts together...here we go).<br>

You have a bunch of friends you always hang out with, one day you realise you cant afford to go out with them -sad wojak- <hr>

You decide you have two choices:<br>
- fuck it, ill go and be broke or<br>
- ill let them know, theyll respect me <br>

you decide to go the latter option, letting them know that this week, youd rather save money on food than getting drunk and feeling hungover. you were honest and they said, "yeah man dont worry about it, completely understand". Cool, this might now be an indicator of respect. you feel good. you go on living your life <br>
This happens a few times bc either youre busy (life comes up yo) or you make the concious choice to not go based on personal situations. you tell them honestly and they say the same thing,  "yeah man dont worry about it, completely understand". <br>
Then one day, you realise that youve got the weekend off! -awesome- but there was no invite? so you reach out to your friends, they mention theyre going out, but didnt reach out, *(you mind starts to spiral, why didnt they invite me? you think to yourself, why did i get left out?)* they invite you but you feel this *weird fooling*. You question why they didnt ask you to come, their response is "well you kept saying no, so we just stopped asking" - this happens alot and is a normal response in social interactions. (i want to stress that this type of dynamic is normal)
This may be nothing but it also might be taken as a personal attack. 
Lets take a deeper look at the response and how it might be taken in different contexts.

"you kept saying no, so we stopped asking" - this can very much be fact, but it imo shouldnt stop someone from reaching out to check in. The assumption that it gets harder to ask the more its pushed back is a funny counter intuitive one. To me it shows that the person is using their own shame of reaching out as a weapon against someone safely being honest and expressing and respecting their own needs.

So i had these friends growing up that would go out and drink every weekend. they all had jobs or were fine with spending money. i was a loner, music nerd who wasnt making anything and everything i tried that wasnt music or something creative i would suck at and failed at or failed to get money for bc i wanted to give it away for free (at the time). So when they invited me out one week i said to them "look man, i cant, i gotta save some money" - at the request of my own mother who was fed up money feeding my 17 year old living at home arse (theres nothing wrong with that btw). I felt alot of shame around not having money growing up and rn am learning to reframe it bc i love money, you cant live without it. <br>
My friend replied w sure man, dont worry i can pay for you. i tried it but it felt even worst. i hated being at the whim of someone elses hard work. it wasnt a gift, it was pity they felt.<br>
so i gained enough confidence one week that when my friend offered i said, na, id rather do this for myself, ill catch you guys soon though yeah? she agreed and then we stopped talking for weeks.
I reached out and randomly but bravely took the leap of confidence to ask her why she hadnt spoken to me, her response shook me to my core, mostly because i couldnt understand it at the time but upon reflection now understand (classic in most cases).
"well you kept saying no, so i stopped asking".
ouch.<br>
was me setting boundaries really the bottle neck to connecting with friends?
this didnt *feel like friendship to me*, but i kept assuming it was, for years at my own detriment.<br>
I have reflected since and have realised a few things (take these with a grain of salt or more if you like, all opinions are my own).<br>

The statement felt like a blame, an attack, not on me personally but on the concept of friendship *to me*. "you kept saying no" - a personal boundary iset to help me in other ways in life - boundaries compound *did you know?*. "so i stopped asking" - the blame piece. (this also connects with feeling attacked by information bc this information was new to me, the idea that if i didnt respond i was going to be outcast, when did that happen? did i miss the fucking memo? where was this information when we were friends all those years? i was so confused). This confusion could lead me to not trust those i connect with (and did in ways un known to me at the time), because apparently (from past experiences) i miss important information that im not careful could outcask me at the drop of a hat, just by choosing myself. if this is the world i live in, i dont wanna. it doesnt feel kind or hold the same reverence to the world i do, why was i born in this world etc, see the spiralling that occurring?.

okay back to the insights and how they connect to these threads:

<b>misinformation</b> - if my world model is based on the information i am getting from my environment and it doesnt seem to fit what i *feel* is correct, who can i talk about it with? am i bound to the limited perspective of those around me? if i am, and i feel attacked by that information, im more likely to CREATE my own that *feels* good. these created models of information may or may not be factually accurate and there is the seed of <b>misinformation</b>.

<b>FOMO</b> - the fear of missing out puts me in a state of panic, and if im panicked im less likely to be curious about how to fix problems and further dig a big hole for myself in *EVERY* aspect of my life - because this compounds over time (this started in friendships but ended up in family dynamics, and relationships further down the track).
<br>
This feeling like an attack is now helping me recalibrate the perspective of using cohersion to connect. This happens all the time in all types of dynamics, and if you have experienced this know <b>*you are not alone*</b>. and if it feels too heavy remember, its just something thats been happening and gone unnoticed, it doesnt mean its bad or good, it just a thing that happens bc it trickles down - and into every aspect. Like water. water isnt inherently bad, we need it, but when we drink too much we drown, it can both drown us, and fuel us. Its a tool in that respect.
This perspective is meant to be as such i guess? i dunno. do with this info whatever you want but like i said, its mine not anyone elses and if you relate, great otherwise thats cool too bro.<br>

The way we use these words, can hurt and can also not mean much (which is how its been able to spread). its upto us to make the choice to explore how they work, and choose if we want to continue using them (as we already have, is it working?) or we choose to make a change. To see things differently and build a better world through the way we communicate.

What could my friend have said or done differently? this is a great question. im not sure i can answer to be fully honest. but lets brainstorm together shall we?<br>
> Hey, i should have reached out, im sorry. honestly it felt weird to ask you when you turned us down so many times but i understand your situation and respect that. forgive me.

I could have said something similar about how my feeling were hurt. I could have been vulnerable. its hard to be vulnerable and often feels counter intuitive bc to the brain it could lead to death. But more often than not, when we arew honest and vulnerable, we find clarity within ourselves and can pass that onto others we connect with.

-this is a work in progress but a small look into my deep perspectives on connection.
