Its never wise to feel someone's feelings, or ignore your own. Left to fester emotions turn to physical feelings - we see this with anxiety mimicking heart attack symptoms. Like the body is getting louder when it tries to speak.
When you assume someone else's feelings, you take their power and sense of agency away. They have their own experiences and tools to handle life, they have their own unique wisdom to practise and to share. When i turn away from hard conversations or listening to my feelings (reminder: make sure to use critical thinking when listening to my feelings and hard conversations), i shy away from greater connection (friendship) and learning. Where as choosing the immediate option, harms long term and severs any form of opportunity for transformed connections (from romantic to friendly or otherwise).
When i hurt and help myself i build tools for understanding who i am and how i learn, and grow. What i like and dislike. I tune into what feels good (because im sad and want to feel better), and then take the steps to do that - this process is so important, and its life long. This exercise builds compassion, empathy and confidence all in one.

The healthy way to navigate this isnt with self-sabotage but with *living*. Just by living we experience forms of disappointment, in workplaces, in relationships, in traffic jams. By practising the skill of self reflection we gain clarity, confidence, self(and worldly)-compassion, empathetic filters as tool on how to navigate or "deal" with the world and protect us and tohse around us. 
Respecting where we ourselves are and where other's are is a valuable thing. It helps us feel seen.
