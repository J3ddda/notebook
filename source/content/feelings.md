The healthy way to navigate this isnt with self-sabotage but with *living*. Just by living we experience forms of disappointment, in workplaces, in relationships, in traffic jams. By practising the skill of self reflection we gain clarity, confidence, self(and worldly)-compassion, empathetic filters as tool on how to navigate or "deal" with the world and protect us and those around us. 
Respecting where we ourselves are and where other's are is a valuable thing. It helps us feel seen.
