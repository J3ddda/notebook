if youre interested in embodiment but arent interested in any of the tools toward the practise of embodiment - thats a red flag.
Define these things before you start (itll bring clarity and with clarity comes understanding, the feeling of satisfaction):
- What is embodiment (for you)?
- Why do you care?
- What are you hoping to achieve?

These questions are great to ask when you want to do something but arent interested in the process. 
Hot-take: embodiment isnt the final boss form, its a tool that is constantly being sharpened. there are many tools that help make it sharper (art is one form).
