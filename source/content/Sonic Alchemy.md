# How it started
Ive been a singer for over 25 years and somewhere along the line i realised that when i would sing **for fun**, i would achieve a *LOT* more (like win a singing competition, make friends, its all win-win really). This realisation lead me into thinking that having fun might actually be some sort of super power and that maybe there is more going on in the body when this happens. - so i started exploring my body with the techniques i learnt from my singing teachers (built on the very strong knees of those who stood before me, as legends in their fields - just humans who love what they do)


### side quest
In 2007 i got diagnosed with an auto immune disease that affects my gut and had me in a choke hold of life. it was hard to do anything but focus on keeping myself alive tbf. In 2014 i used the same techniques id been experimenting with through singing (mostly diaphragm breathing) to put that auto immune disease into **remission (still in remission at time of writing: 26.03.25)**.


Realising this i decided to *pivot marketing* not only for singers but those wanting to get more *in touch with their body*.

**Hard truths: you cant get into embodiment without getting more in touch with your body through a practise (any practise, this is what art does).**

Singing for me has been a way to seamlessly integrate my mind and body at the same time. You may or may not resonate with the process, and thats totally okay, but these exercises are fundamental to (this form of) expression. You cant choose to have one without the other.
Dont fall in love with pieces of a person, you fall in love as a whole. The same must be said about the embodiment process.


# The techniques

Singing isn’t just about your voice; it's about your body. Here are 3 bizarre (but genius) exercises I use to help people 'unlock' (it was never locked away) their voice by tricking their brain into letting their body take the lead.

  

1/ The Yawn Effect

Ever yawn just because someone mentions yawning? Yeah, that.

Turns out, when I tell you to “put your mouth where you yawn,” you’ll yawn. Every. Single. Time.

  

Proof that your body thrives on repetition and this shape makes your voice sound richer without you even trying. 

  

2/ Deep Tissue Tongue Workout

You work out your pecs, but not your yapper? Big mistake.

The tongue is one of the strongest muscles in your body, yet most people ignore it (dont do that, itll make it sad).

  

I get my clients to stretch their cheeks with their tongue while singing the alphabet. It sounds weird, but it:

- Relieves jaw tension

- Eases cheek pressure

- Wakes up muscles you forgot existed (hello awareness)

  

3/ The Shake It Out

Dogs do it, and they’re onto something in my opinion.

Whenever my students' brains start hijacking their bodies, I get them to shake it out. Literally.

It’s like hitting the reset button/ helps you go from "holy crap my brain won't shut up" to calm and clear in seconds.

  

“I discovered this one after performing a fast, intense song and immediately needing to switch gears into a slow, emotional piece. My adrenaline was still buzzing, and I couldn’t reset...

Until I shook it out!!!! Boom, calm restored. Now I teach it to everyone. Works like a charm. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME”

  

These tricks are weird. But they work. Because your body learns best when your brain chills out and lets instinct take over. - to make it clear, the point isnt to disconnect the brain from the process, its to give the brain things to think about (it loves doing the thinking) while giving the body exercises to do (body loves repetition), in doing so you're tapping into the ability to link both body and mind into a single (fun) task and work together to problem-solve (alignment). 


Also side quest/note is that I can do this in 15mins(min). I’d love to see if these exercises work on a large scale group (I’m thinking 150? There’s again a sweet spot for attention and community-maxing). Feel free to reach out if you want to experiment w me.

  

> Trust your instincts man, more often than not they're really wise, they have a literal WEALTH of experience (your personal experience babe, get it?).

hope this helps / inspires xo
