"youre intellectulaising it" - yeah.
is that a bad thing?
why is intellectualising sex considered a bad thing?
Why cant my mind be involved in the pleasure? is it not allowed?
why does my mind have to be absent in the presence of pleasure?
social norms, thats why, bc there hasnt ever been a way to involve the mind during sex, only that it "disconnects sex" - im going against a very big grain here.
