its not so black and white
life never is, its a spectrum. and i want to design things that help people see and feel that in real life.
I want to make things that light a fire of inspiration to see and feel that life isn't so black and white. it has nuances and is more like a rainbow than a line. comedy does this so well. - a create example of something that helps people see from both sides while keeping it light and funny.<br>
