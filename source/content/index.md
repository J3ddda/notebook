hello hi hey, this is a space of ideas / insights / learnings / exploration / experimentation / love.
Some are my tweets, some are journal entries on specific topics.
Some are random insights i have while showering.
All are welcome here.
Come as you are, be loved as you are.<br>
"if it feels good, do it" - I teach body awareness through singing exercises designed to remove personal stigma.

### I'm currently fascinated by:

- How emotions (and therefore ideas) spread through communities.
- Exploring the concept of why respect for the body is downplayed alongside cognitive endeavours.
- How eugenic principles are ending up in data collection and how to best *stop* that from happening and discontinuing harmful bias.
- the human body and its innate intelligence

## My philosophy: dont force.

# What i want more of:

- Yoga that teaches people not only body positions in systemic approaches to belief but the belief that the body is a complex navigator and can and does help us daily. - use radio signals to align posture/position to music, so when you do a yoga pose the move to the position is static but the position itself creates a radio signal sound (music etc). you get to know the position and your body (win-win).
- People to gain greater clarity and agency over their bodies to make informed decisions. 
- dyslexic books that lean into what the brain sees when you have dyslexia. A book that looks like what my brain wants to focus on; the spaces between the words, the bright circles surrounding each letter and the ability to read even when the letters are not arranged traditional ways.
- The "black/white", "nighttime/daytime" button on this site to be able to be coloured (like i want a coloured background, not just light and dark bc life isnt just light and dark, there are also dawn and dust, midday and midnight, sunrise and sunset and they all look different and i want my site to reflect that and change...or someone to have a colour picker to change it to a colour that best suits their mood at the time, and have that change, as their mood/frame of mind does) Who's making this or can walk me though it? - i wanna learn, teach me oh jedi!!(and dont say chatgpt bc thats no fun, the point here is socialisation and learning together okay? its a win-win, get it? good.)
- dating app that that funds itself my being honest abut selling data and allowing their members to choose what data they disclose and sell for profit, so they dont have to ask their customers for money to connect with each other (controversial i know).
  
<h1>How this research will help:</h1>
- creates a sense of agency that allows people to speak up about injustices in a safe and productive way (the thing stopping you from speaking up might be mostly fear of being reprimanded?, or fear the thing thats happening is gunna happen to you?, but when we speak up, we notice we arnt alone, we tend to outnumber those who hide in shame 10-1*not actual data but id like to see that data one day possibly*)

- help ease the pressure of doctors and the wait time to see said doctors especially in ER hospital as people will *know* if they are sick or just feeling intense emotions.

- you get to know the position of your mind and your body (win-win), if people trust their body there will automatically be trust in life (and others) as a fix/alignment in one area often causes compounding in all areas (memetics)

## what im currently focused on
"people rarely see past the end of thier nose" - to widen the lens.
- novel concepts in art, expression and traditional institutions
- emotional signaling - emotions as signals (like traffic lights). They tell you where a person is at. There are lots of different emotions, and trying to map signals are look going in circles.
## morals
- tangable
- alive
- respectful
- consentual
