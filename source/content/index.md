hello hi hey, this is my notebook of ideas.
Some are my tweets, some are journal entries on specific topics.
Some are random insights i have while showering.
All are welcome here.
Come as you are, be loved as you are.<br>
"if it feels good, do it" - I teach body awareness through exercises designed to remove personal stigma at [Visit Sonic Spaceship](https://confused-ton-5c4.notion.site/Welcome-Aboard-the-Sonic-Spaceship-17657185b7388061a737de28490d8787)

<h1>I'm currently fascinated by:</h1>

- How emotions (and therefore ideas) spread through communities.
- Exploring the concept of why respect for the body is downplayed alongside cognitive endeavours.
- How eugenic principles are ending up in data collection and how to best *stop* that from happening and discontinuing harmful bias.

<h2>My philosophy: dont force.</h2>

<h1>What i want more of:</h1>

- Yoga that teaches people not only body positions in systemic approaches to belief but the belief that the body is a complex navigator and can and does help us daily. - use radio signals to align posture/position to music, so when you do a yoga pose the move to the position is static but the position itself creates a radio signal sound (music etc). you get to know the position and your body (win-win).
- People to gain greater clarity and agency over their bodies to make informed decisions. 
  
<h1>How this research will help:</h1>
- creates a sense of agency that allows people to speak up about injustices in a safe and productive way (the thing stopping you from speaking up might be mostly fear of being reprimanded, or fear the thing thats happening is gunna happen to you, but when we speak up we notice we arnt alone, we tend to outnumber those who hide in shame 10-1)<br>
- help ease the pressure of doctors and the wait time to see said doctors especially in ER hospital as people will *know* if they are sick or just feeling intense emotions.<br>
- you get to know the position of your mind and your body (win-win), if people trust their body there will automatically be trust in life (and others) as a fix/alignment in one area often causes compounding in all areas (memetics)
