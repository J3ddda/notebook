i love thinking of new app ideas or ways to make websites/social media better. (i did this with myspace and layouts that changed the function of the page, i did this with vapirefreaks and the cults*groups* they allowed. scraper bots to invite those who resonated with my welcome msg was the best tbh)
ways of getting a wider frame of reference. a ways of mapping how people interact. *can i map emotions through word searches?* .[[horny]][[feelings]][[body]][[ai]]
